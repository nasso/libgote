//! \brief An event channel.

//! Event channels have a ring buffer of events. Subscribing to a channel gives
//! you a handle you can use to poll events independently from other
//! subscribers. Subscribers must regularly poll events, because the ring buffer
//! will keep growing as long as there are subscribers with events pending!

//! about the events, otherwise the event channel's internal buffer will keep

//! \ref gt_event_channel_unsub or calling \ref gt_event_channel_discard_all if
//! you don't care about the events in the channel.
